Okay, back to reality, first things first, if you want to publish a simple GitHub page for the world to view you will need a few things:
### Tools
- Reliable web browser such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Languages
- Markdown is the language you will utilize for this GitHub pages tutorial. Below will be a link to some resources you can utilize if you are unfamiliar with the language.
- CSS, HTML, and JavaScript will be useful but not for creating your first and simple GitHub page (see details below).
## Recommended Resources
- Here's that [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) link I promised. This will walk you through the basics and have you practice writing in the language.
    - If you would rather explore a guide, then check out this [getting started guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for markdown
- Using GitHub can be very confusing at first, so look through this [GitHub Basics](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) page to get more comfortable with some of the cool features offered
- Visual Studio Code offers a [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) on their site over the basics of their program. Do not take this tool for granted because it offers a lot of neat stuff! Including extensions avaiable for download within the program to make your life easier, so take advantage!
- Markdown is a nice light-weight language to get you started but eventually you will want to move on to the main fundamentals of website development, and that is HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are few resources to become a master at these languages:
    - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) will get you started with documentation and exaples of each language
    - When you feel you have grasped the main concepts of each language, put your skills to the test and [practice](https://html-css-js.com/). This site offers a text editor for practice as well as a cheatsheet and the websites own helpful links.

Remember, you have to make mistakes to learn, so don't get stressed over your code, only learn from your mistakes.
