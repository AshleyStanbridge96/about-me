            <h2>Current</h2>
            <p>
                I am a senior studying Computer Science and will graduate with a bachelor's degree this December. I am
                what you
                would call a "super senior" which means I have outstayed my welcome for the traditional 4 years of
                school, so I
                am very excited to graduate.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Before attending Northwest, I went to MACC (Moberly Area Community College) in Kirksville, MO and earned
                my
                associate of arts degree. My hometown is technically Ottumwa, IA but I have spent enough time in
                Kirksville, MO
                to include that as a hometown as well. My main hobbies outside of school is binging Amazon Prime, Hulu,
                and
                Netflix shows. When I'm not doing that, you can find me playing Madden 2019 on the PlayStation 4 where I
                will
                probably be yelling at the television for a bad call on the football play.

            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>
                I'm not certain on what my career plans will be. I want to find a job out of college (like anyone else)
                but I
                don't want to be tied down to anything I may not enjoy. During the summer, I interned at Pella
                Corporation where
                their information technology (IT) role had multiple teams (i.e. infrastructure, mobile development,
                website
                development, etc.). So my time at Pella made me realize I want to work in an environment where I could
                easily
                switch from one thing to another and not forever be tied down to a specific position. With that being
                said, my
                main interests in computer science include: mobile development, databases, web development, quality
                assurance/testing, and scripting.

                Something interesting about myself would be I have been to 48 states thanks to my Dad being a truck
                driver. I
                have gone on the road with him every summer for the past 20 years. Alaska and Hawaii are the last two I
                need to
                visit someday. Here is a link to my <a
